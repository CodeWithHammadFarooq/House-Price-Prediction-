üè° Housing Price Prediction Project
This project focuses on predicting housing prices using a supervised machine learning approach. Leveraging Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn, the workflow involves:

Loading and exploring a housing dataset

Preprocessing data (e.g., encoding categorical variables, handling missing values)

Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets

Training a Linear Regression model

Evaluating model performance and visualizing results

The goal is to build a reliable regression model that can estimate housing prices based on key features like area, number of bedrooms, furnishing status, and location-related attributes.
